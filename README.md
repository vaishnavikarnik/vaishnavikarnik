# 👋 Hi, I’m Vaishnavi Karnik

### 📊 Aspiring Data Analyst | 🐍 Python & SQL Learner | 🌸 Creative Explorer

I’ve worked on a few projects involving **Python, SQL, Power Bi, EDA, and data visualization**, and I’m continuing to build more as I grow. Each project helps me sharpen both my technical skills and my **ability to identify the right problems to solve** — a skill I believe is just as important as solving them.

Currently, I’m exploring **advanced SQL projects**, and preparing to dive into **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** soon.

Working on real-world data makes me feel alive — it gives me space to **experiment, reflect, and expand my thinking**.

> ⚡ **Fun fact:** I used to ask *“why?”* in philosophy — now I ask it in every step of my analysis. It keeps my curiosity alive and insights honest.
