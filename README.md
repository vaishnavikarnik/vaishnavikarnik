# 👋 Hi, I’m Vaishnavi Karnik

### 📊 Aspiring Data Analyst | 🐍 Python & SQL Learner | 🌸 Creative Explorer

I’ve worked on a few projects involving **Python, SQL, Power BI, EDA, and data visualization**, and I’m continuing to build more as I grow. Each project helps me sharpen both my technical skills and my **ability to identify the right problems to solve** — a skill I believe is just as important as solving them. I'm especially interested in **deriving statistical insights** that not only explain what’s happening in the data — but why it’s happening.


Currently, I’m exploring:
- 🧠 **Deep Learning** with `Keras` and `TensorFlow`
- 🔍 **Advanced SQL use-cases** for dashboards & analytics
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**, focusing on real-world applications

Working on real-world data makes me feel alive — it gives me space to **experiment, reflect, and expand my thinking**.
